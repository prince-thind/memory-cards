# Memory Cards

Memory cards is a basic game built using React. The game is played as follows:

1. The player selects a card from the set of given cards - each with a distinct picture
2. The cards are then shuffled automatically
3. The player now has to click on only those cards which they haven't clicked before
4. Repeat from step 2.
5. Once all cards have been clicked without any repitition, the player wins
6. The result of selecting a card that has been selected before leads to game over.
